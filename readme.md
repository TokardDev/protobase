# ProtoBase
## Intro :
This code is designed to work with an Arduino board, specifically an ESP-32 WROOM. It utilizes a custom hub to connect directly to LED panels for control.

This code uses ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA.h and Adafruit DMA libraries for LED matrix control and smooth animation.

This project can be done by anyone as the Gerber files will be available. For those who lack the skills or prefer to buy directly, pre-programmed hubs are also available for purchase.

## Hardware used :

ESP32 (wroom in my case)

2 64x32 led matrices

possibly an sd card reader

4 tacts buttons

## features
LED matrix control
Animations
Reading from SD card
Face changing via buttons
Customizable faces
Direct connection to LED panels via custom hub
Gerber files available for DIY-ers
Option to purchase pre-programmed hubs

## Other

I had a great time working on this code and it's definitely one of my biggest personal projects ! 

I would like to give a big thank you to PanickingLynx for his help with the hardware aspect of this project! They did a similar project that inspired me a lot, don't hesitate to check ! 

I want to add that this project is completely open-source and the sale of hubs is mainly to open up the world of protogens to more people, support my work if someone decides to, and to offer a product made for this purpose, not just disguised dropshipping like some others. If anyone needs any help, I am always open to questions and happy to help in any way I can.

Making my project useful for others is truly something fantastic for me. I am happy to have the opportunity to share and help someone. 

## Oh ! One more thing !
If anyone uses my code and creates something with it, I would be interested to see ! You can contact me on Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Instagram or any other platforms ! I am always eager to see how others build upon and expand upon my work, and I am happy to provide any support or assistance they may need ! 

#### Thanks for using my code !
