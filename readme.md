# ProtoBase
## Intro :
This code is designed to work with an Arduino board, specifically an ESP-32 WROOM. It utilizes a custom hub to connect directly to LED panels for control.

This code uses ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA.h and Adafruit DMA libraries for LED matrix control and smooth animation.

## Hardware used :

2 ESP32 (wroom in my case)

2 64x32 led matrices

possibly an sd card reader

4 buttons

## Other

I would like to give a big thank you to PanickingLynx for his help with the hardware aspect of this project! They did a similar project that inspired me a lot, don't hesitate to check ! 


## Oh ! One more thing !
If anyone uses my code and creates something with it, I would be interested to see ! You can contact me on Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Instagram or any other platforms ! I am always eager to see how others build upon and expand upon my work, and I am happy to provide any support or assistance they may need ! 

#### Thanks for using my code !
